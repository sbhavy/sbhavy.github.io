I am a first-year CS PhD student at the [National University of Singapore](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/).

Previously, I graduated from the [University of Southern California](https://viterbischool.usc.edu/) (MS CS), where I worked with [Dr. Seon Ho Kim](https://sites.google.com/view/skim-home/home). Prior to that, I graduated from the [National Institute of Technology Delhi](https://nitdelhi.ac.in/) (BTech CSE), advised by [Dr. Anurag Singh](https://anuragsg52.github.io/index.html).
