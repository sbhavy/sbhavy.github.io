I am a first-year CS PhD student at the [National University of Singapore](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/), co-advised by [Dr Roger Zimmermann](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/people/rogerz/) and [Dr Tan Zhi Xuan](https://ztangent.github.io/).

My research interest lies in **Cooperative Intelligence**. Particularly, I am curious about understanding and developing **cooperative infrastructures** that help self-interested agents achieve mutually beneficial outcomes.

To that end, I seek to answer the following research questions.

* **Automated Negotiation<sup>[1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1008746126376)</sup>**: How to quantify the "goodness" of a negotiation? How well do agents adhere to the *contracts* developed so?
* **Bayesian Norm Learning**: How do norms emerge? How do agents reason their compliance to a norm?
* **Decentralized Coordination**: Even in the absence of explicit communication and centralized delegation, how do agents coordinate?

The following ideas inspire my research: *[Coasean bargaining](https://blog.cosmos-institute.org/p/coasean-bargaining-at-scale)*, *[contractualism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17434)*, and *[pluralistic AI alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16984)*. My work heavily uses concepts from *Bayesian inference*, *theory of mind*, *game theory*, and *multi-agent reinforcement learning*.


Before starting my PhD journey, my interest lied in computer vision for urban analytics. Previously, I graduated from the [University of Southern California](https://viterbischool.usc.edu/) (MS CS), where I worked with [Dr. Seon Ho Kim](https://sites.google.com/view/skim-home/home) in the [Integrated Media Systems Center](https://imsc.usc.edu/) (IMSC). 
Prior to that, I graduated from the [National Institute of Technology Delhi](https://nitdelhi.ac.in/) (BTech CSE), advised by [Dr. Anurag Singh](https://anuragsg52.github.io/index.html).
