I am a first-year CS PhD student at the [National University of Singapore](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/).

My research interest lies in [Cooperative AI](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/cooperative-ai-1), incorporating ideas from *Bayesian inference*, *game theory*, and *reinforcement learning*.

Particularly, I am curious about understanding and developing **cooperative infrastructures** for settings that involve self-interested agents. 

To that end, I seek to answer the following research questions.

* **Automated Negotiation**: How to quantify the "goodness" of a negotiation? How well do agents adhere to the *contracts* developed so?
* **Bayesian Norm Learning**: How do people decide what norms to follow, and to what degree? When is it "okay" to break away from a norm?

My research is motivated by ideas such as *[Coasean bargaining](https://blog.cosmos-institute.org/p/coasean-bargaining-at-scale)*, *[contractualism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17434)*, and *[pluralistic AI alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16984)*.


My former research was in computer vision for urban analytics. Previously, I graduated from the [University of Southern California](https://viterbischool.usc.edu/) (MS CS), where I worked with [Dr. Seon Ho Kim](https://sites.google.com/view/skim-home/home) in the [Integrated Media Systems Center](https://imsc.usc.edu/) (IMSC). 
Prior to that, I graduated from the [National Institute of Technology Delhi](https://nitdelhi.ac.in/) (BTech CSE), advised by [Dr. Anurag Singh](https://anuragsg52.github.io/index.html).
