I am a first-year CS PhD student at the [National University of Singapore](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/).

My research interest lies in [**Cooperative AI**](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/cooperative-ai-1), which uses ideas from *Bayesian inference, game theory, and multi-agent reinforcement learning*.

I am particularly curious about understanding and developing *cooperative infrastructures*; enabling cooperation between self-interested AI agents.
To this end, I seek to answer the following questions.

* **Automated Negotiation**: What does a rational natural language negotiation look like? What changes when AI agents negotiate on behalf of human principals?
* **Bayesian Norm Learning**: How do people decide what norms to follow, and to what degree? When is it "okay" to break away from a norm?

My research is motivated by ideas such as *Coasean bargaining, contractualism, and pluralistic AI alignment*.

My former research was in machine vision for urban computing. Previously, I graduated from the [University of Southern California](https://viterbischool.usc.edu/) (MS CS), where I worked with [Dr. Seon Ho Kim](https://sites.google.com/view/skim-home/home) in the [Integrated Media Systems Center](https://imsc.usc.edu/) (IMSC). 
Prior to that, I graduated from the [National Institute of Technology Delhi](https://nitdelhi.ac.in/) (BTech CSE), advised by [Dr. Anurag Singh](https://anuragsg52.github.io/index.html).
